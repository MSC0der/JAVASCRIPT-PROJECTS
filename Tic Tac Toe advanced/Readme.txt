This is not a basic tic tac toe game it is an advance variation which comes with two options that are 2players and vsComputer option. The option 2players was learnt from the free Youtube tutorial form Apna College. Then after learning the basics from there I added a feature that is the VsComputer in this it is a very basic option that I have used, I have used random feature to generate  the index of box, then I check if the box is empty or not, if the box is empty I change the inner text feature to update the box. Then if I receive an index that is not empty I recall the random function to generate it. If you check the console then you will able to see the random function being called several times. Then I use Scroll to feature that help me scroll to the game and the results when they are called it is a very basic yet a clean project that showcases my skills for the language JAVASCRIPT.
